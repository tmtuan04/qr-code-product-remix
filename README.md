# Shopify QR Code App with Remix

This is a sample Shopify app built with [Remix](https://remix.run/), using the official [@shopify/shopify-app-remix](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/shopify-app-remix) package.

- The app allows merchants to **generate QR codes for their products**.
- When a QR code is scanned, it redirects the customer to either a checkout page preloaded with the product, or to the product detail page.
- Every QR code scan is logged and scan analytics are shown inside the app.
